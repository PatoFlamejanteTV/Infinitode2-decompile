OPEN HTML TO PDF relies on several other free or open source projects in 
order to build and run. All currently used libraries are thought to have licenses compatible with the LGPL.
However, there are several jars under the obsolete-archive folder that are no longer used 
and their licenses are out of the scope of this document. Please check the license before
using any of those jars.
